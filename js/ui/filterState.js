/**
 * filterState.js
 *
 * Encapsulates all UI filter states (toggles and selections) for a single fight.
 * Each fight gets its own FilterState instance, preventing cross-fight contamination.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Manage boolean toggles for rendering options (auto attacks, combined DoTs, etc.).
 *   - Track selected players for row/column filtering.
 *   - Provide methods to reset state (e.g. clear player selections).
 *   - Ensure state is encapsulated per fight instance (no global leakage).
