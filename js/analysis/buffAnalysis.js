/**
 * Purpose:
 *   When a buff is listed on a damage event but no active status
 *   window matches at that timestamp, this function looks back
 *   within a configurable window (default: 30s) to find the most
 *   recent expired status of the same buff and credits that source.
 *
 * Why:
 *   Some buffs may expire just before the server registers the
 *   associated damage event, leading to missing attributions.
 *   This prevents "lost" credits for buffs that were clearly active
 *   moments before the damage was applied.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Finds the most recent status with the same buff whose `end`
 *     is within `lookbackWindow` ms before the event.
 *   - Credits that source to the FightTable row.
 *   - Logs the assignment for debugging and traceability.
 *
 * @param {string} buffName - Buff being applied
 * @param {Object} ev - The current damage event
 * @param {Array} statusList - Buff/debuff timelines
 * @param {Object} row - The FightTable row being updated
 * @param {Object} fight - Fight metadata (for logging)
 * @param {number} [lookbackWindow=30000] - Lookback window in ms
 * @returns {boolean} true if a backfill credit was applied, false otherwise

/**
 * Purpose:
 *   Ensures every buff in the FightTable has a valid credited source.
 *
 * Why:
 *   After applying buffs and attempting backfill, some buffs may still
 *   have no source (empty array) or only invalid "Unknown" placeholders.
 *   This function guarantees that the FightTable has no unassigned buffs.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Iterates through all rows and buffs.
 *   - If a buff has no valid appliers, credits *all* friendly players.
 *   - Logs a warning to indicate normalization was required.
 *
 * Tradeoff:
 *   This avoids rendering empty buff columns, but it inflates
 *   attribution by giving credit to everyone. Used only as a last resort.

 * @param {Map} actorById - Map of actorID â†’ actor metadata
 * @param {Object} fight - Fight metadata (for logging)
