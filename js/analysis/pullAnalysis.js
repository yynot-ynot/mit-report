/**
 * Generate a condensed version of a fight table by grouping related attacks together.
 *
 * This function scans through a fight’s damage table and produces a summarized structure
 * where sequential attacks of the same name — occurring close together in time —
 * are grouped into a single "condensed attack set".
 *
 * Each condensed set represents a mechanic or burst window, combining all related
 * attacks, buffs, mitigation, and death state data into one summary block.
 *
 * ---
 * GROUPING LOGIC
 * ---
 * 1. Iterate through all fight table rows in chronological order.
 * 2. Group attacks by their ability name (e.g., "Fear of Death", "Attack").
 * 3. A new group is started when:
 *    - It's the first occurrence of that ability, OR
 *    - The current attack occurs more than 2000 ms (2 seconds) after
 *      the first attack in the current group for that ability.
 * 4. All attacks within that time window are collected as a single "set".
 *
 * ---
 * OUTPUT STRUCTURE
 * ---
 * Returns a **new object** (not a mutation of fightTable) structured as:
 *
 * {
 *   fightId: number,
 *   encounterId: number,
 *   name: string,
 *   condensedSets: [
 *     {
 *       timestamp: number,          // earliest timestamp among grouped attacks
 *       ability: string,            // name of the attack group
 *
 *       // --- Aggregated per-player summary (stats + buffs + death state) ---
 *       players: {
 *         [playerName: string]: {
 *           buffs: [ "Buff1", "Buff2", ... ],  // merged list of buffs applied by this player
 *           unmitigatedAmount: number,         // total unmitigated damage across all grouped hits
 *           amount: number,                    // total mitigated damage taken
 *           absorbed: number,                  // total absorbed/shielded amount
 *           mitigationPct: number,             // average % mitigated (mean of all hits)
 *           intendedMitPct: number,            // average intended mitigation (mean of all hits)
 *           dead: boolean,                     // true if dead in any hit within the group
 *           wasTargeted: boolean               // true if this player was the target (actor) in any hit
 *         }
 *       },
 *
 *       // --- Child events (subset of FightTable.rows entries) ---
 *       children: [
 *         {
 *           timestamp: number,
 *           actor: string,               // player who took the hit
 *           ability: string,             // ability name
 *           amount: number,              // post-mitigation damage
 *           unmitigatedAmount: number,   // pre-mitigation damage
 *           absorbed: number,            // shielded value
 *           mitigationPct: number,       // % mitigated from data
 *           intendedMitPct: number,      // % intended from buffs
 *           buffs: { [buffName]: [appliers...] }, // buffs active during hit
 *           deaths: [string],            // players dead at that time
 *           source?: string              // attacker name (if available)
 *         },
 *         ...
 *       ]
 *     },
 *     ...
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * ---
 * PLAYER PARTICIPATION SCENARIOS
 * ---
 * This condensed structure distinguishes between three player involvement cases:
 *
 * 1️⃣ **Buff-only contributor**
 *    - Player applied one or more buffs but was not targeted by any attack.
 *    - `buffs`: populated with all buffs they contributed.
 *    - All damage-related fields remain `0`.
 *    - `wasTargeted = false`.
 *
 *    Example:
 *    {
 *      "Ethan Enjio": {
 *        buffs: ["Kerachole"],
 *        unmitigatedAmount: 0,
 *        amount: 0,
 *        absorbed: 0,
 *        mitigationPct: 0,
 *        intendedMitPct: 0,
 *        dead: false,
 *        wasTargeted: false
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * 2️⃣ **Attack target (damage recipient)**
 *    - Player was the target of one or more attacks in the set (even if shields absorbed all damage).
 *    - `buffs`: lists any buffs they also contributed, if applicable.
 *    - Damage and mitigation fields are aggregated normally.
 *    - `wasTargeted = true`.
 *
 *    Example:
 *    {
 *      "Akrui Tesh": {
 *        buffs: [],
 *        unmitigatedAmount: 81793,
 *        amount: 59627,
 *        absorbed: 0,
 *        mitigationPct: 27,
 *        intendedMitPct: 31,
 *        dead: false,
 *        wasTargeted: true
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * 3️⃣ **Uninvolved player**
 *    - Player neither applied a buff nor was targeted by any attack in this set.
 *    - They are **not included** in the `players` object for this set.
 *
 * ---
 * EDGE CASES
 * ---
 * - If two identical attack names occur more than 2 seconds apart,
 *   they form separate condensed sets.
 * - Buff lists are deduplicated per player.
 * - Players without buffs still appear if they were targeted by an attack.
 * - Players whose shields fully absorbed damage are still marked `wasTargeted = true`.
 * - Empty or malformed fight tables result in an empty `condensedSets` array.
 *
 * ---
 * RETURN VALUE
 * ---
 * Returns a **new object**:
 * {
 *   fightId,
 *   encounterId,
 *   name,
 *   condensedSets
 * }
 *
 * The original fightTable is left unmodified.
 *
 * @param {Object} fightTable - The FightTable to condense.
 * @returns {{
 *   fightId: number,
 *   encounterId: number,
 *   name: string,
 *   condensedSets: Array<{
 *     timestamp: number,
 *     ability: string,

 *       buffs: string[],
